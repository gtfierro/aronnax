\section{Metadata Model}

Telemetry databases such as Prometheus~\cite{prometheus} and
InfluxData~\cite{influxdata} will often use a stream's description as its
unique identifier and further qualify it with a small series of tags; for
example a stream named \texttt{total\_http\_requests} might have a tag of
\texttt{hostname=host1.example.com}. With this construction, the database makes
the assumption that changing any aspect/context of the stream warrants the
creation of an entirely new timeseries stream with a new identifier. 

This is fine for telemetry data, but when we consider the more general case of
physical timeseries data, we require a different definition of \emph{stream
provenance}.

We do not wish to propose a solution to Theseus' Paradox: for our purposes, a UUID is the definition of
a data source
