\section*{Appendix}

For the following temporal query:

\begin{sqlcode}
select * where Metadata/Exposure = 'South' at now
and Location/Room = '411' at now
and Location/Building = 'Soda' at now
\end{sqlcode}

we generate the following SQL query

\onecolumn
\begin{sqlcode}
select second.uuid, second.dkey, second.dval
from (
   select data.uuid, data.dkey, data.dval
   from data
   inner join
   (
        select distinct uuid, dkey, max(timestamp) as maxtime from data
        group by dkey, uuid order by timestamp desc
   ) sorted
   on data.uuid = sorted.uuid and data.dkey = sorted.dkey and data.timestamp = sorted.maxtime
   where data.dval is not null
) as second
right join
(
    select distinct a.uuid from
    (
        select distinct data.uuid
        from data
        inner join
        (
            select distinct uuid, dkey, max(timestamp) as maxtime from data
            group by dkey, uuid order by timestamp desc
        ) sorted
        on data.uuid = sorted.uuid and data.dkey = sorted.dkey and data.timestamp = sorted.maxtime
        where data.dval is not null
            and (data.dkey = "Metadata/Exposure" and data.dval = 'South')
    ) as a
    inner join
    (
        select distinct data.uuid

        inner join
        (

        on data.uuid = sorted.uuid and data.dkey = sorted.dkey and data.timestamp = sorted.maxtime

    inner join
