- See Praveen Seshadri’s work on SEQ and SEQUIN for langauge and optimization ideas
- Probably also want to go through the stream query lit
- [Object/Stream identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)
- Need queries to be “federated” across metadata and data
       - Make sure temporal semantics align with stream data query semantics (BtrDB?)
       - Aligning timestamps of data and queries across the two systems
       - Continuous metadata queries
- Are data profiles (summary statistics) metadata?  Or data?
- If metadata is generated by machine you’ll need fine-grained time.  If by humans then not.
- Is it reasonable to assume clock synchrony across devices?  Do you need to support multiple “opinions” or “perspectives” on time?
- A challenge: post-hoc time rectification
       - Temporal data cleaning challenges
       - More generally, temporal semantics.  See the work of Snodgrass etc on TSQL.
       - See the Antelope/ReplayDB philosophy of “log” vs. “computations over the log”
