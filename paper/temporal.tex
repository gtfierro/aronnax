\section{Temporal Metadata Model} \label{section:temporal}

In this section, we extend our metadata model with a temporal dimension that
enables the applications in Section~\ref{section:motivation}. To do this effectively, we first
discuss our notions of \emph{time} and how to mitigate discrepancies between client and server.
We then examine established temporal data models such as the Bitemporal Conceptual Data Model (BCDM).
Because most research into temporal data models has been conerned with relational or spatial models,
these models are more complicated than needed for a simple EAV table.

\begin{itemize}
\item then start talking about temporal query languages?
\item temporal query language tquel~\cite{snodgrass1987temporal}
\item tsql2~\cite{snodgrass2012tsql2}
\item tquery~\cite{kahn1991tquery}
\item differentiate from continuous query languages like CQL~\cite{arasu2006cql}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is Time?}

There are two flavors of time that temporal database must deal with:
\emph{valid time} and \emph{transaction time}~\cite{jensen1999temporal}\cite{jensen1996semantics}. 

\textbf{Valid time} is the extent for which a given \emph{fact} is true. For
our model, a fact is the association of a key-value pair with a stream,
changing the value associated with a stream's key, or removing a key-value pair
from a stream's metadata. Valid time is expressed in terms of real-world time
and is how metadata facts are aligned with timeseries data, which is stored
using real-world time. Because valid time is the coordinating aspect across the
two databases (timeseries and metadata), it is also the point of interaction
for consumers of data.

A fact's valid time can be qualified either by a single time (``start'') or by
a duration (``start'' and ``end''). Duration-based facts are used in most of
the established relational models (I believe because they make temporal joins
easier to reason about).  The use of a start-time lends itself to diff-based
storage, where facts for each \texttt{<uuid, key>} pair are considered valid
until a new fact is written for the same \texttt{<uuid, key>} pair. This also
removes the need to invalidate past facts, which is a drawback of the
bitemporal model (BCDM).

\textbf{Transaction time} is a logical timestamp that represents when a fact
takes place in relation to other facts. In a temporal database where all
entries are made at the current time, transaction time can be conflated with
valid time, but if the database allows retroactive inserts, then these two
times must be separate. In our demo implementation, transaction time is made
implicit through the use of transactions on the underlying database. Unlike
valid times, which maybe added in the past, transaction times are strictly
monotonic.

A temporal database must decide whether or not to make these timestamps
explicit in the representation and query interface.  While these two views of
time are orthogonal~\cite{snodgrass1986temporal}, some databases such as
POSTGRES~\cite{stonebraker1990implementation} conflate the two into transaction
time and only maintain a history of changes so far as to resolve concurrent
transactions. Transaction times are useful for ordering incoming operations,
but do not need to be factored into the query model. Thus, our model makes
valid timestamps explicit in the storage and retrieval of facts, but
transaction times are kept internal to the DBMS.

have a figure here? start-time vs duration time?

\subsection{Temporal Data Models}

\begin{itemize}
\item BCDM bitemporal conceptual data model: only captures when facts are valid in reality and when stored in database~\cite{jensen1996semantics}\cite{jensen1994unifying}
\item incremental relational temporal model: \cite{jensen1991incremental}
\item relational algebra accounts for transaction time, evolution of contents as well as schema~\cite{mckenzie1990schema}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proposed Temporal Query Language}

Figure~\ref{fig:temporalgrammar} contains a simplified grammar of our proposed temporal query language.
