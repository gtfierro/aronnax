\section{Metadata Model}

In this section, we describe a natural model for a stream of timeseries data
and its associated metadata. We then discuss the set of possible database
representations of this metadata, choosing an Entity-Attribute-Value
(EAV)~\cite{chen1976entity} model. Then, we briefly review a query language
based on sMAP~\cite{dawson2010smap} designed to retrieve both timeseries and
metadata using this model.

\begin{itemize}
\item First establish what our normal timeseries and metadata looks like
  \begin{itemize}
  \item document UUID, bag of key-value pairs
  \item Overview of how data gets deposited: what is current system's opinion on timestamps?
  \item What does the current ``query language'' for these look like:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item selecting timeseries data based on metadata
      \item selecting metadata based on metadata
      \end{itemize}
  \item Data representation: EAV table
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
