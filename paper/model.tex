\begin{itemize}
\item First establish what our normal timeseries and metadata looks like
  \begin{itemize}
  \item document UUID, bag of key-value pairs
  \item Overview of how data gets deposited: what is current system's opinion on timestamps?
  \item What does the current ``query language'' for these look like:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item selecting timeseries data based on metadata
      \item selecting metadata based on metadata
      \end{itemize}
  \item Data representation: EAV table
  \end{itemize}
\item Discuss current tmporal data models
    \begin{itemize}
    \item TODO: make this list
    \item OURS: how to augment with time: add column to EAV
    \end{itemize}
\item discuss sql vs nosql for demo implementation?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item SQL more suited for diffs?
    \item NoSQL more suited for replication?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
